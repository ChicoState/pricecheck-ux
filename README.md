# PriceCheck

Problem:

There has been many times where I order something on amazon and shortly after I realize I could've gotten it cheaper on a different website...

Innovation:

A chrome extension that'll check the prices of products across multiple websites (amazon, eBay, newegg, etc...) and return a link if a cheaper price is found.

Tech:

Chrome extension, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Creating personas and scenarios allowed the **target demographic to be narrowed down** to technologically-savvy users looking to save time and money
* Competitive analysis showed **little competition for PriceCheck’s niche** of minimalistic price checking
* Heuristic evaluation of the main competitor for PriceCheck **revealed effectiveness and efficiency issues**, giving us a better understanding of what to focus on for PriceCheck’s UI design
* Sketches enabled us to start visualizing what the UI with the app will look like, **emphasizing minimal user interactions**
