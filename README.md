# PriceCheck

```
Problem:
There has been many times where I order something on amazon and shortly after I realize I could've gotten it cheaper on a different website...
Innovation:
A chrome extension that'll check the prices of products across multiple websites (amazon, eBay, newegg, etc...) and return a link if a cheaper price is found.
Tech: Chrome extension, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
