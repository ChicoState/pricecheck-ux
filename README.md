# PriceCheck

Problem:

There has been many times where I order something on amazon and shortly after I realize I could've gotten it cheaper on a different website...

Innovation:

A chrome extension that'll check the prices of products across multiple websites (amazon, eBay, newegg, etc...) and return a link if a cheaper price is found.

Tech:

Chrome extension, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Creating personas and scenarios allowed the **target demographic to be narrowed down** to technologically-savvy users looking to save time and money
* Competitive analysis showed **little competition for PriceCheck’s niche** of minimalistic price checking
* Heuristic evaluation of the main competitor for PriceCheck **revealed effectiveness and efficiency issues**, giving us a better understanding of what to focus on for PriceCheck’s UI design
* Sketches enabled us to start visualizing what the UI with the app will look like, **emphasizing minimal user interactions**

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* Reached out to people outside of our group for **feedback on our current designs**
* **Discovered pain points for new users** in PriceCheck’s interface from cognitive walkthroughs
* Found that **users are generally able to complete their goals** while using PriceCheck
* Learned that users are interested in the Alerts feature, and **invested more time in designing it**

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

We conducted user tests on the PriceCheck prototype, and got valuable feedback:
* PriceCheck’s prototype was praised for its simple layout and ease of navigation for first-time users.
Users had difficulty with Honey’s search results and alert system, leading to a lower average ease-of-use score (3.5/5).
* PriceCheck scored significantly higher in ease-of-use (4.7/5) for both finding items and creating alerts.
* When compared directly with Honey, users found PriceCheck more efficient, though satisfaction scores were more varied due to Honey’s richer product details.
* Key suggestions for improvement included:
  * Adding more detailed item descriptions (including prices and images)
  * Clarifying price labels (e.g., “Best Used Price” vs. “Best Price”)
  * Simplifying alert creation by removing the need to know the current price
* Findings indicate strong user demand for a tool like PriceCheck, with future iterations needing to balance clarity, simplicity, and feature richness
