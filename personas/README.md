## Parts no longer sold at local retailers
Blake’s shop receives an old computer that is going to need a completely new motherboard. It
is a rare model, and many of the local stores may not even carry the correct sized board. He is
already crunched for time, and this is a priority order. He doesn’t have time to go to stores and
investigate, or scour the internet for the best deal. Blake wants a way to search the name of the
part, and get a list of places to buy it and the price it's at.

## Graphics card catches on fire
Jeff after classes for the day decides to boot up his stream and start his work for his audience.
When the stream starts up he finds that his pc starts to lag a little. Checking his stream he finds
that the video quality really drops and his pc temps start to rise. After a minute the pc shuts
down and his graphics card ends up dying. Now he can walk to best buy but or his local
hardware store but the prices are a bit too outrageous. Jeff thinks to himself “Where can I get
the best graphics card at a cheaper price as soon as possible.”
