# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. Only include research methods in here, not design documents/techniques/artifacts !!!

## Findings

From our user tests, we were able to get valuable user data and feature suggestions.  The previous experiences for the users with other price saving tools was generally negative, with most claiming they often wouldn’t work.  This shows that there is definitely a need for working apps like PriceCheck.  During the tests against competitor Honey, users identified major issues with the search engine’s ability.  All of the users had difficulties finding the item that they were supposed to, as the search results were specific enough to their search.  They found that they would have to search through results that seemed to not be arranged in any useful order.  After this, users also generally had difficulty recognizing Honey’s “Droplist” icon when setting an alert for the item.  Because of the lack of labeling to the icon, some users struggled to find it, with one third of users not being able to complete the task.  For both finding an item and creating an alert, users gave Honey a mean score of 3.5 out of 5.

When testing the PriceCheck’s prototype, users appreciated the simpler layout, which was shown by less confusion when navigating the app.  However, some users felt that the item page could have had more information in the item descriptions, such as prices and images of the listings.  Users also expressed that there could have been some confusion between the “Best Brand New Price” and “Best Price”, the latter of which would be more appropriate to call “Best Used Price”.  While creating an alert, one user pointed out that the current system doesn’t have an easy way to look for any price drop, and requires them to have the current price known to them already.  Overall, users gave PriceCheck’s both ease of use scores for finding an item and creating an alert a 4.7 out of 5.  During the debrief, when we asked users to compare PriceCheck to Honey, on average, users found that PriceCheck was a more efficient app, however, when rating satisfaction, there was a greater spread across the results, as some felt that Honey’s more informational item descriptions made them feel like they were getting the best prices.

## Conclusions

From the insights that the users were able to highlight the demand and potential for PriceCheck in the market of price-saving tools.  Users generally had negative experiences with competition in the field such as Honey, citing the weak search and unclear interface.  PriceCheck’s clear layout and simple design were beneficial to user interactions, and made navigation much easier for a newcomer to the app.  The comparison with Honey allowed for users to point out some valuable features missing from the app, such as displaying the prices and images of the listings on the item page, and modifying the alert creation to default at certain prices.  Future iterations of PriceCheck will have to take these features into consideration while also balancing the simplicity and efficiency focused design of the app.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
