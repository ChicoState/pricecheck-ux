# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. Only include research methods in here, not design documents/techniques/artifacts !!!

## Findings

After performing competitive analysis, we were surprised to find relatively little competition for similar products.  Many of the alternatives to PriceCheck are websites only, and the main competitor was found to be Honey, which is known to have recently been exposed for misleading its users, and not giving them the actual discounts and lowest prices it offers.  We dug further into Honey with the heuristic evaluation, and found that in addition to this lack of Visibility of System Status, the product was weaker in the areas of aesthetic and minimalist design, and flexibility and efficiency of use.  These two areas were mainly affected by the bloated nature of Honey, which makes navigating the extension difficult, and causes it to cover a lot of content on the user’s browser.  We felt that this was a major drawback for a user’s experience with a browser extension.

After confirming with the software team that the app was going to be focused on PC parts, rather than a generic price checking app, we were able to make more personalized design decisions to help us generalize how users would interact with the extension.  During our creation of personas and scenarios, we realized that the average user of this site would likely be a more technologically savvy user, who’s main goals are to use the app to help them save time and money.  This means that we can focus on making streamlined, non-intrusive designs for our users, who likely don’t need many additional features or instructions to use the app.  During our sketches, we were able to emphasize these design aspects, and aimed to design the most minimal yet functional app design possible.

## Conclusions

From our early research, we were able to derive that our product is meant to be targeted towards a very specific demographic of technologically savvy users, who know what they are looking to purchase already, and just want to find the product at the lowest price without any effort.  Using this more narrow demographic, we can make decisions towards designing a UI more tailored for their experience in our early sketches.  We felt that competitors in this space did not have such an efficiency-focused approach, which means PriceCheck may be able to perfectly fill this niche.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
