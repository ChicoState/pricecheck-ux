# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

PriceCheck is an extension that will check prices across multiple websites to help users find a better price. The extension will return a link to the item once a cheaper option is found. Finding these prices will help users save money. 

## Methods

The UX team explored a range of different research methods to gain a deeper insight into improvements for the extension, with the goal to enhance the user experience. The first of these research methods was competitive analysis, which we used to explore our competitors to see the areas we can make improvements in. We found three of the most popular competitors, tested their extension multiple times and wrote down five different categories to understand their product. These five categories being strength, weaknesses, quality level, price/cost, and the platform it is on.

The next research method the UX team conducted was the creation of personas and scenarios. We created two different personas based on our target demographic and gave them a mini background to get a better understanding of what our users would need from our extension. The UX team made two scenarios for the personas to help us understand why someone would use our extension.

The final research method explored by the UX team was the heuristic evaluation. The UX team identified our biggest competitor and applied [Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) to evaluate them on their product. We went through the list of Nielsen’s Heuristics, which are Visibility of System Status, Match Between the System and the Real World, User Control and Freedom, Consistency and Standards, Error Prevention, Recognition Rather than Recall, Flexibility and Efficiency of Use, Aesthetic and Minimalist Design, Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors, and Help and Documentation. After going through each of the Heuristics the UX team evaluated the extension on a scale of 1-10 for each of the heuristics.

## Findings

After performing competitive analysis, we were surprised to find relatively little competition for similar products.  Many of the alternatives to PriceCheck are websites only, and the main competitor was found to be Honey, which is known to have recently been exposed for misleading its users, and not giving them the actual discounts and lowest prices it offers.  We dug further into Honey with the heuristic evaluation, and found that in addition to this lack of Visibility of System Status, the product was weaker in the areas of aesthetic and minimalist design, and flexibility and efficiency of use.  These two areas were mainly affected by the bloated nature of Honey, which makes navigating the extension difficult, and causes it to cover a lot of content on the user’s browser.  We felt that this was a major drawback for a user’s experience with a browser extension.

After confirming with the software team that the app was going to be focused on PC parts, rather than a generic price checking app, we were able to make more personalized design decisions to help us generalize how users would interact with the extension.  During our creation of personas and scenarios, we realized that the average user of this site would likely be a more technologically savvy user, who’s main goals are to use the app to help them save time and money.  This means that we can focus on making streamlined, non-intrusive designs for our users, who likely don’t need many additional features or instructions to use the app.  During our sketches, we were able to emphasize these design aspects, and aimed to design the most minimal yet functional app design possible.

## Conclusions

From our early research, we were able to derive that our product is meant to be targeted towards a very specific demographic of technologically savvy users, who know what they are looking to purchase already, and just want to find the product at the lowest price without any effort.  Using this more narrow demographic, we can make decisions towards designing a UI more tailored for their experience in our early sketches.  We felt that competitors in this space did not have such an efficiency-focused approach, which means PriceCheck may be able to perfectly fill this niche.

## Caveats

One caveat was the lack of information due to the Honey extension not returning any valid deals during the UX team’s competitive analysis research. Another being only two members in the UX team, which led to the team not finding all of the information that we wanted.
