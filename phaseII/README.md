# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

In our last report, we ended with heuristic evaluations and were left with questions about how to create our own visualization for the UX extension our team was designing. The main goal of this sprint was to learn how to use wireframes as a visual representation of our extension and to gather feedback from other teams.

## Methods

For this sprint, the UX team explored a new range of methods to gain a greater understanding of what to improve for the extension. The first of these methods being a **Cognitive Walkthrough**. For the Cognitive Walkthrough, the UX team engaged with team members from other groups to provide feedback on the UX team’s wireframe. The UX team Cognitive Walkthrough was performed by uploading our wireframe on Slack workspace. Then, two volunteers participated by analyzing the UX teams wireframe  by using the personas and scenarios the UX had previously developed. The walkthrough sessions helped us identify usability issues and potential improvements from the perspective of our target users. 

The final research method explored in this sprint was an **Informal Feedback**. For this method, the UX team prepared multiple questions for the PriceCheck software team to gather feedback on the extension from the CSCI 430 class. This method allowed us to get a greater understanding of design considerations and user preferences of the extension. 58 people proceeded to participate in this feedback session, giving us an idea on how to improve upon the product.

## Findings

After we posed questions to the software team’s class regarding first-time user interactions with the extension, we received helpful feedback suggesting that the extension should not open automatically, but rather be activated by the user through a click. This aligns with our original design goals of keeping the experience as non-intrusive as possible.

During our cognitive walkthroughs of the app, we found that users were generally able to complete their intended tasks, which was encouraging. However, we also received several valuable suggestions for improvement. Some users noted the need for clearer confirmation when setting alerts, as it was not always apparent that the action had been completed.  This would have to be added as another wireframe to our existing model. Additionally, there was some confusion around the "History" section, as to whether it referred to search history or price tracking history.  Moving forward, we will clarify this by changing the button to say “Price History”. Lastly, users felt that the search and alert functionalities might benefit from additional visual cues to help them know whether actions they are taking are doing anything.  This will be an important part of designing later models of PriceCheck to account for user satisfaction.

## Conclusions

This round of feedback helped us gain insight into how people outside our group perceive and interact with our design. While our goal remains to create a streamlined and minimalist user experience, we were able to recognize the importance of providing a fair amount of guidance and feedback for new users. Additionally, we introduced a dedicated page for creating and managing alerts, giving users more clarity and control. In later prototypes of PriceCheck, we intend to add more visible feedback cues throughout the app to confirm successful actions, which will greatly improve user satisfaction.

## Caveats

One caveat of our method Cognitive Walkthrough were limitations of feedback of only two participants. Another would be that the UX team was not present for the Informal feedback, meaning we could not get the notes our selves.
